This is a library used to parse the complete Gamedata for the very data driven web3 game Million on Mars, which is a huge simulation/ inventory management type of game with tons of recipes.
Fetching and parsing the Games data in addition to current marketplace data from wax.io makes it possible to find profitable crafts for players.
This library served as the backbone to different personal frontend services to make it easier to consume the data on a glance, but was also used in a discord bot to automate messages about interesting deals.
